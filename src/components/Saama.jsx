            <div className='section--text'>
            Spirited Away is one of my favorite movies, I was always struck by the scene of the river god who appears in the bathhouse as a pestilent and filthy god who, thanks to everyone's help, manages to clean himself of all the garbage that he had been accumulating and from which he alone could not free himself.  I have been in that place and that is why this integral unlocking technique learned from the hand of Veturián Arana, I experience it precisely as that, an energetic spa.  Cleanse the emotional baggage, mental and even spiritual energies that we have accumulated over the years and that affect our psyche, including our physical body.  Reset, balance, calibrate, erase and integrate the energies that your soul needs most at this vital moment through binary questions and answers and quantum kinesiology.
